				<h4>Controls Engineering Intern/Research, Brookhaven National Laboratory</h4>
				<ul>
						<li>Developed an <a href="https://epics-controls.org/">EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control

					<li>Used C++ for the primary driver that interfaced with the device API directly.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Allowed for control over ethernet</li>
						<li>Preserves GUI control using a CS-Studio screen</li>
						<li>Used C++ bindings of EPICS</li>

				<h2><b>Skills</b></h2>
				<h3><b>Computing</b></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>HDL Programming</b>: Lots of experience in VHDL from classes, and some
						Verilog experience from personal projects
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Serial</b> Communication: Formal experience from multiple class and informal
						experience from countless random personal projects
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Plan to develop this skill further by developing VHDL program that
							uses UART to communicate
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						<b>Hardware-Software Interfaces</b>: Developing interfaces between physical hardware
						and either user-friendly programs or firmware
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Firmware experience comes largely from class and in the form of both
							assembly and C
						</li>
						<li>
							Connecting hardware to user-friendly programs in my experience has
							largely fallen under the task of controls engineering during my
							internship at BNL
						</li>
						<li>
							I have done a few projects where I developed both firmware-level
							and user-level programs that work alongside each other
						</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<h3>Programming Languages (In order of how much I like them)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Java</b>: So many projects that I can't count (I accidentally deleted around
						twenty in 2018), easily my most proficient language. If I need to get something
						to work correctly quickly, I do it in Java
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project: Hard to choose</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>C/C++</b>: I am more familiar with C++ than C, but have been using both in
						some form for at least since 2019. Most of my C knowledge comes from embedded
						programming with various microcontrollers, while most of my C++ knowledge comes
						from game engine development
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project (C): Embedded Chess Engine</li>
							<li>Favorite Project (C++): VR Engine</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Assembly</b>: So far I am mostly proficient in Arm assembly, and as of the
						Spring 2025 semester I am taking two classes about MIPS processors and programming
						them, so I'm certain I will be confident in MIPS assembly soon enough
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project: Fancy Schmancy UART driver</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>TypeScript/JavaScript</b>: Although these are two very separate languages,
						I am grouping them because I don't actually use plain JavaScript for all that much,
						only for projects that don't need much interactivity, like this website. I far
						prefer TypeScript, and have used it for a lot of projects so far. I can admit
						I don't always write the cleanest code, but I haven't stumbled across a frontend
						project that I haven't been able to crack with some TypeScript
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project: monke.gay</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>VHDL</b>: Not super proficient relative to professionals, but pretty decent in
						the context of being a student. I seem to be in a very small subset of people
						who enjoy writing VHDL despite the crime that is its syntax, and I hope to get
						much better at VHDL in the future (maybe at a co-op?)
						<ul>
							<li>
								No favorite project yet, but there is likely soon to be one
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>SQL</b>: About as proficient in SQL as I feel I'll ever need to be, even though
						that's largely the basics. I have used MySQL as the database backend for several projects,
						both for storing authentication hashes/salts and for storing player data and inventories
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project: Schedge.net</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Python</b>: I am pretty solid at Python, and have programmed a lot of projects
						using it, since as much as I may hate it, it works pretty well for small tasks. I
						also used it at my BNL internship, as I needed to use the ophyd, bluesky, and caproto
						libraries extensively. Despite being very good at Python, I despise the syntax and
						if given the option will use pretty much anything else
						<ul>
							<li>
								Favorite Project: FRC Scouting Discord Bot
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Verilog</b>: I only have Verilog at the bottom of this list due to the fact that
						I have very little experience with it, but have used it. I'm certain that if I took
						the time to learn more Verilog that I would enjoy it more than Python
						<ul>
							<li>Favorite Project: Basic FPGA Video Card</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Web Technologies</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>WebSockets</b>: I have done a few projects now that required the use of
						WebSockets. Personally I'm a huge fan aside from the relatively small HTTP overhead,
						and they have fit seamlessly into projects that otherwise would have been impossible.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>HTML/CSS</b>: I didn't include this with the programming languages since HTML and
						CSS aren't programming languages, but I have used them in every project that included
						TypeScript or JavaScript, aside from a single project with NodeJS. I have used them
						in both normal web design as well as to design interfaces with microcontrollers like
						the ESP32
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>NGNIX</b>: I use NGINX for hosting the webserver that handles every website I have created,
						those being mainly <a href="http://adamschultzer.com">this website</a>,
						<a href="https://schedge.net/">Schedge.net</a>, and <a href="https://monke.gay">monke.gay</a>,
						as well as various other projects hosted as subpages of those websites. I have messed around
						a lot with the configurations to get everything working as I want, which has given me a lot
						of experience with getting them right
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Software Proficiencies</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>The Obvious</b>: </li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>IDEs/Editors</b>: VSCode, Visual Studio, Vim, Keil &#181Vision, Quartus Prime, Vivado, Notepad++</li>
						<li><b>Document Creation</b>: Google Suite, Microsoft Suite, LaTeX</li>
						<li><b>Operating Systems</b>: Windows, Linux (mostly Debian)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><b>The Less Obvious</b></li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>3D Modelling/CAD/3D Printing</b>: Blender, Fusion 360, Onshape, Cura Slicer</li>
						<li><b>Music/Audio</b>: Musescore, Audacity</li>
						<li><b>Graphics</b>: paint.net, Inkscape</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
