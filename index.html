				<h2><b>Work Experience</b></h2>
				<h4>Controls Engineering Intern/Research, Brookhaven National Laboratory</h4>
				<ul>
						<li>Developed an <a href="https://epics-controls.org/">EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control
							System)</a> control driver to interface with the 
						<a href="https://www.biologic.net/products/vsp-300/">BioLogic VSP-300</a>.</li>
					<li>Driver interfaces with the <a href="https://blueskyproject.io">bluesky</a>
						experiment orchestration framework in order to be used alongside
						existing systems in the <a href="">NSLSII (National Synchrotron Light Source II)</a></li>
					<li>Interfaces with major experiments on roughly a third of the NSLSII
						facility's <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/beamlines/">beamlines</a></li>
					<li>Eliminated a large manual step in using the device, allowing many more
						experiments to be fully automated</li>
					<li>Used C++ for the primary driver that interfaced with the device API directly.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Allowed for control over ethernet</li>
						<li>Preserves GUI control using a CS-Studio screen</li>
						<li>Used C++ bindings of EPICS</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Used Python for a secondary driver that interfaced with hardware outputs
						on the physical device.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Did not interfere with function of vendor software</li>
						<li>Focused on tracking important datapoints in order to
							control experiment flow</li>
						<li>Used <a href="https://nsls-ii.github.io/ophyd/">ophyd</a> python bindings</li>
					</ul>

						<b><a href="https://schedge.net/">Schedge.net</a></b>
						<ul>
							<li>An appointment and reservation system, originally built to assist
								in scheduling appointments for my high school's Tutoring Club</li>
							<li>Frontend logic written in TypeScript, with visuals being done
								with standard HTML and CSS</li>
							<li>Backend logic written using Java, with a MySQL database
								for the account and reservation data handling.</li>
							<li>Future plans to create systems for creating student schedules,
								both per semester and for the future using data from course catalogs
								<ul>
									<li>May be RIT specific at first</li>
									<li>Not a work in progress, this is a completely unstarted idea</li>

						<b><a href="http://adamschultzer.com/anthill/">WebGL Game (anthill)</a></b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Created with the intent to teach myself about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">WebGL</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								Uses primarily TypeScript for logic and GLSL for shaders
							</li>
							<li>
								Texture defined color maps, extremely easy to change visuals
								of game with only a few pixel changes to textures.
								<ul>
									<li>
										2D texture for terrain with altitude on one axis and
										slope of terrain on the other allows for easy customization
									</li>
									<li>
										1D texture for water allows foam near coastline to be
										customized easily, where the x-axis correlates with
										depth of the water.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Solidified many previously learned OpenGL and general graphics
								programming skills

						<b>Multiplayer Game with Marching Cubes Terrain (slavv)</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								I have no memory of why I called it "slavv"
							</li>
							<li>
								Created with the intent to teach myself about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes">Marching Cubes</a>

							<ul>
								<li>This led me down a very long and tedious rabbithole resulting in another project</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Solidified previously learned socket and network programming skills</li>
							<li>
								Used Java for both client and server, with 
								<a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> for OpenGL bindings
							</li>
							<li>
								Currently not in a working state due to me losing a large
								chunk of the code (but somehow not all of it) when I accidentally
								wiped my laptop's hard drive

						<b>C++ VR Game Engine</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Created with the intent to teach myself about programming in C++ and programming for VR
							</li>
							<li>
								Used OpenVR when it wasn't based on OpenXR (this is old) and C++
							</li>
							<li>
								Has not been touched in several years and I would like

							<ul>
								<li>This was probably obvious</li>
							</ul>
							<li>
								Used a variant of Verilog
							</li>
							<li>
								Output a valid VGA video output that was accepted by
								a monitor.
							</li>
							<li>
								Lower effective resolution than actual VGA resolution
								due to clock speed limitations
							</li>
							<li>
								Displayed geometric shapes and patterns as a test case
